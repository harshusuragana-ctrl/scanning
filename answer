Interview Questions & Answers


1. What is vulnerability scanning?

Vulnerability scanning is the automated process of finding security weaknesses in systems, applications, or networks. It identifies outdated software, missing patches, and misconfigurations that could be exploited.

2. Difference between vulnerability scanning and penetration testing?

Vulnerability Scanning: Automated, broad detection of known weaknesses. It shows what vulnerabilities exist.

Penetration Testing: Manual + automated simulation of real attacks. It shows how those vulnerabilities could be exploited.

3. What are some common vulnerabilities in personal computers?

Missing OS/security patches

Weak or reused passwords

Outdated browsers/software

Open/unnecessary ports and services

Misconfigured firewalls

No antivirus/antimalware protection

4. How do scanners detect vulnerabilities?

They compare system data with known vulnerability databases (CVE/CVSS) using methods like:

Banner grabbing (service/software version detection)

Port scanning

Misconfiguration checks

Weak/default credential tests

5. What is CVSS?

CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) is a framework for rating the severity of security flaws.

0.0‚Äì3.9: Low

4.0‚Äì6.9: Medium

7.0‚Äì8.9: High

9.0‚Äì10.0: Critical

6. How often should vulnerability scans be performed?

Regularly: monthly or quarterly for personal systems

After major software/OS updates

Before and after deploying new applications

7. What is a false positive in vulnerability scanning?

A false positive occurs when a scanner reports a vulnerability that does not actually exist. It often happens due to misconfigurations, outdated vulnerability databases, or inaccurate version detection.

8. How do you prioritize vulnerabilities?

Use CVSS score (Critical first)

Assess asset importance (e.g., servers vs. personal PCs)

Consider exploit availability

Fix critical/high issues immediately, then medium/low
